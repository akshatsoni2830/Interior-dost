# Interior-Dost: 90-Second Future Scope Pitch

## Opening (15 seconds)

"Interior-Dost starts as a 2D web app because that's where we prove value fastest. Upload a photo, get your room redesigned in 90 seconds. Zero cost to operate, zero friction for users. But the architecture we've built today is designed to scale intelligently."

## The Foundation (20 seconds)

"Our current system already captures everything we need for 3D. When our Vision AI analyzes a room, it extracts spatial context—room type, objects, dimensions, lighting. Our geometry preservation logic? That's implicit 3D understanding. We're not just generating pretty pictures; we're building a spatial reasoning engine."

## Phase 1: 3D Visualization (25 seconds)

"Once we hit 10,000 monthly users and 15% conversion on furniture links, we introduce Three.js-based 3D visualization. Users can rotate the room, see it from any angle, validate furniture placement. The data we're collecting today maps directly to 3D scene parameters. No architectural changes needed—just a new rendering layer on the client side."

## Phase 2: AR Integration (20 seconds)

"When 3D shows 25% engagement and users explicitly ask to see furniture in their space, we add WebAR. No app installation—works in mobile browser. Users scan their room, place furniture, verify it fits. Industry data shows AR reduces returns by 35% and increases conversion by 25%. That's when the investment pays for itself."

## Phase 3: VR for B2B (10 seconds)

"VR isn't for consumers—it's for builders and designers. Real estate developers showing apartments before construction. Interior firms presenting to clients. High-value B2B contracts, not mass market."

## Closing (10 seconds)

"We're not chasing technology trends. Each phase unlocks only when the previous proves clear demand and revenue. We build what users actually want, not what we think they might need. That's how we scale sustainably."

## Key Talking Points (If Questions Arise)

**"Why not start with 3D/AR?"**
- "Because we need to prove users want this before investing 30-50 lakhs in development. 2D validates the core value proposition with zero infrastructure cost."

**"What's your competitive advantage?"**
- "We're the only platform built specifically for Indian homes with geometry-preserving AI. Our architecture captures spatial data from day one, so we can scale to 3D without rebuilding."

**"When do you expect to launch 3D?"**
- "6-12 months after launch, contingent on hitting user and revenue milestones. We're data-driven, not timeline-driven."

**"How do you monetize?"**
- "Furniture affiliate commissions today. Premium 3D features and B2B licensing tomorrow. AR increases conversion enough to justify the development cost."

**Delivery Tips:**
- Speak confidently but not rushed
- Pause after "spatial reasoning engine" and "investment pays for itself"
- Make eye contact during the closing
- Have the full pitch document ready for detailed questions

**Total Time:** 90 seconds (270-300 words at conversational pace)
